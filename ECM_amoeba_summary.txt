SUMMARY OF: Cooper, Wingreen & Cox (2012)
An Excitable Cortex and Memory Model Successfully Predicts New Pseudopod Dynamics

============================================================
CORE IDEA
============================================================
This paper introduces the Excitable Cortex & Memory (EC&M) model to explain how
amoeboid cells (e.g. Dictyostelium discoideum) move persistently without external
guidance. Cells extend pseudopods in an alternating left–right (zig-zag) pattern.
The key discovery is that each pseudopod leaves behind a temporary, spatially
diffusing cortical “memory” that increases local excitability, while simultaneously
producing local and global inhibition. As a result, pseudopod placement is
non‑Markovian and depends on the spatial and temporal history of previous
pseudopods.

============================================================
MODEL GEOMETRY
============================================================
• Cell cortex modeled as a 1D circular domain (angle θ or arc-length x)
• Pseudopods are discrete excitable bursts on the cortex
• Cell motion is derived from active pseudopod directions

============================================================
STATE VARIABLES
============================================================
M(x,t) : Cortical memory (excitability enhancer)
L(x,t) : Local inhibitor (refractory + lifetime control)
G(t)   : Global inhibitor (binary, whole-cell)

============================================================
EQUATIONS GOVERNING PSEUDOPOD DYNAMICS
============================================================

(1) Pseudopod initiation rate

C_start(x,t) =
    ε * [ M(x,t)^3 / (1 + a L(x,t)) ] * [ 1 / (1 + b G(t)) ]

• Cubic dependence on M creates excitable behavior
• Local inhibitor L suppresses nearby pseudopods
• Global inhibitor G suppresses all new pseudopods while one is active


(2) Cortical memory evolution

∂M/∂t =
    k0
  + k1 * P_pseudopod(x,t)
  − M / τ_M
  + D_M ∇²M

• Memory accumulates where pseudopods were active
• Memory decays slowly and diffuses along the cortex
• This term creates directional persistence


(3) Local inhibitor evolution

∂L/∂t =
    k_L * P_pseudopod(x,t)
  − L / τ_L
  + D_L ∇²L

• Produces refractory period
• Limits pseudopod lifetime
• Decays faster than memory (τ_L << τ_M)


(4) Pseudopod termination rate

C_stop = μ * L^3

• Cubic dependence yields realistic lifetime distributions


============================================================
CELL-LEVEL MOTION
============================================================
Cell centroid motion follows a persistent random walk derived from
pseudopod directions.

Mean squared displacement:

⟨r²(t)⟩ =
  2 v² τ_p [ t − τ_p (1 − e^(−t/τ_p)) ]

• τ_p ≈ 3–9 minutes, matching experiments


============================================================
KEY BIOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS (ALL VERIFIED EXPERIMENTALLY)
============================================================
• Zig-zag probability increases with distance from parent pseudopod
• Zig-zag peaks when parent and grandparent are ~90° apart
• Children of non–zig-zagging parents zig-zag more often
• Larger / longer-lived pseudopods create stronger memory
• Zig-zag bias decays after ~30–40 seconds (memory lifetime)


============================================================
PARAMETERS (SIMULATION VALUES)
============================================================
k0   = 0.1 s⁻¹        (basal memory production)
k1   = 1.4 s⁻¹        (memory production at pseudopods)
τ_M  = 30 s           (memory lifetime)
D_M  = 0.14 μm²/s     (memory diffusion)

k_L  = 0.3 s⁻¹        (local inhibitor production)
τ_L  = 2.33 s         (local inhibitor lifetime)
D_L  = 0.1 μm²/s      (local inhibitor diffusion)

ε    = 2.5e−5 s⁻¹ μm⁻¹ (pseudopod initiation scale)
a    = 34             (local inhibition strength)
b    = 11             (global inhibition strength)
μ    = 1 s⁻¹          (termination rate scaling)

IMPLICATIONS FOR OPENGL / SDF AMOEBA SIMULATION
============================================================

Represent cortex as:
• Circular parameter space θ ∈ [0, 2π)
• Fields M(θ), L(θ) stored as 1D textures or buffers

Simulation loop:
1. Diffuse and decay M and L (reaction–diffusion step)
2. Spawn pseudopods probabilistically via C_start
3. Terminate pseudopods via C_stop
4. Update G globally if any pseudopod is active

SDF Geometry:
• Base cell: smooth implicit blob (circle / superellipse)
• Pseudopods: time‑limited SDF lobes extruded along surface normal
• L field suppresses nearby lobe creation
• M field biases lobe placement toward previous sites

Visual realism:
• Memory M modulates membrane roughness / actin texture
• Local inhibitor L creates visible refractory “smooth” zones
• Global inhibition reduces simultaneous protrusions
• Shape evolution is history‑dependent, not noise‑driven

============================================================
CONCLUSION
============================================================
The EC&M model shows that realistic amoeboid motion emerges from excitable
dynamics plus spatial memory. This framework is directly translatable to SDF‑based
OpenGL simulations, producing biologically faithful, persistent, zig‑zagging motion
without scripting trajectories or forces.
